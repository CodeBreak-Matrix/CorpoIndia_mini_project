# CorpoIndia_mini_project
Contains the csv files and cleaning scripts used for data processing in my BTech CS mini project - Data Analysis.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate report on the economic and corporate landscape in our country, India.
By leveraging the power of data analysis, we can generate useful insights from readily available data which can be used by the general populace to empower themselves.

All scripts are made in Python ver. 3.11.7.
In order to run and use these scripts, the following packages/libraries are required:
  1. PySpark
  2. Pandas
  3. csv
  4. OS
  5. datetime<br/>

Some may already be installed with your existing python installation while others may require manual installation using pip module.
